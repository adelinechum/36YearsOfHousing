  <h1><b>36 YEARS OF HOUSING</b></h1>
  <h3><b>Created By: Adam Vosburgh, Adeline Chum, and Jonathan Chester</b></h3>
  <p> For: Jia Zhang’s Fall 2020 DataViz for the Humanities course at the Columbia GSAPP</p>
  <br>
  <h2>This project is about the<b> Columbia GSAPP's Housing Studio,</b>  which began in 1974 as a result of student activism and the coordinated interests of new faculty. The studio has continued in different iterations over the 40+ years since, and has changed with the dominant ideas in architecture as well as with the social political and economic pressures on the city. 
    36 YEARS OF HOUSING is centered around two components: <b>Data</b> comprised of individual student projects, and <b>Tags</b> which are an attempt to draw some lessons from the past 40 or so years of production out of them. </h2>
  <h2>36 YEARS OF HOUSING was made by three Master of Architecture students during their completion of the Housing Studio, but would not have been possible without the work done in 2014 by the GSAPP Exhibitions Team, in a retrospective of the GSAPP Housing Studio titled <b>“GSAPP Housing Studios, 1974-2014.”</b></h2>
    <p>The 2014 GSAPP Exhibition Team comprised of:
    <b>Director of Exhibitions: </b> Mark Wasuita, <b>Exhibition Coordinator:</b> Adam Bandler, <b>CCCP Exhibitions Assistant: </b>Florencia Alvarez Pacheco, <b>CCCP Research Squad: </b>Alissa Anderson, Liyana Hasnan, Maite Borjabad, Pedro Cenal Murga, Rayna Razmilic Triantafilo, Rosana Elkhatib, Tania Tovar Torres, Virginia Black, 
    <b>M. Arch Exhibitions Assistants:</b> Brittany Roy, Megan Murdock, Sareeta Patel, <b>M.Arch Exhibitions Crew: </b>Andrew Hite, Dasylva Bolton, Dong Joo Kim, Emily Mohr, Grete Grubelich, Huynh Ngoc Ho, Ilijana Soldan, Jorge Cornet, Julie Pedtke, Rebecca Book, Yitao Wang, Yujing Mandy Han, 
    <b>Exhibition Design:</b> Adam Bandler, Florencia Alvarez, Mark Wasuita, <b>Graphic Design:</b> MTWTF</p>
<br>
<h2> A NOTE ON <b>DATA</b></h2>
<p>The archive that 36 YEARS OF HOUSING is based off of is incomplete and biased. For the years up to and including 2014, we relied on the projects curated by the Exhibition Team, who themselves were relying on projects curated in each release of <i>Precis</i> or <i>Abstract</i>, two yearly pulications of GSAPP work. 
  As a result there is only one project per studio per year, resulting in 4 - 8 projects depending on the year, and of these only one image is shown, while the text is sometimes from the studio critic's brief, and sometimes from the student's project. The projects seen here cannot be taken as a representative sample
  of the GSAPP Housing Studio's production, but rather as representative of what the faculty and administration want to be seen as representative of the studio's production.
<br><br>
For 2015 and on, the archive is more complete, but still imperfect. Hosted on the Columbia GSAPP's website is anywhere from 50%-75% of each studio's work, however the format is not as consistent. 
We individually formatted each of those projects to include as much information we could find about them, including the description of the project itself in the case that it was available.
</p>
<br>
<h2> A NOTE ON <b>TAGS</b></h2>
<p>Because the text included with each project was impartial and not always from a consistent source, we had to rely on the only document we had for every year to attempt to compare the Housing Studio apples-to-apples, the <b>Coordinator's Studio Brief.</b> </p>
